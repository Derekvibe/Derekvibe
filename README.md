Hi, I go by the alias "Derek". I'm skilled in a wide range of technical abilities that I obtained and honed through self-education. I possess working proficiency in various programming languages such as Javascript, ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, HTML5, and CSS3. I am comfortable using the Git version control. I am experienced in creating both internal and user-facing support and learning documentation. With over three years of experience as a front-end developer and technical writer, I am well-structured and imaginative in my approach to writing documentation that adds value to both beginner and senior developers' learning journeys.
