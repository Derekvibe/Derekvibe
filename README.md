# 👋 Hi, I'm Derek (Okoro Emmanuel Nzube)

## 🚀 About Me  
**Front-End Engineer | Technical Writer | Product-Focused Developer**

I’m a developer who enjoys building **clean, scalable, and user-focused web applications**—and explaining how they work in a way others can actually understand.

My core strength is **front-end engineering with React**, but I’m equally comfortable working across the stack when needed. I care deeply about **code quality, developer experience, and clarity**, whether that’s in UI design or technical documentation.

I’ve written widely read technical articles, built real-world products, and I’m constantly sharpening my skills across modern web technologies.
