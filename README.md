# 👋 Hi, I'm Derek (Okoro Emmanuel Nzube)

## 🚀 About Me  
**Front-End Engineer | Technical Writer | Product-Oriented Developer**

I build **production-ready web applications** with a strong focus on **admin dashboards, internal tools, and user-facing products**.

My work goes beyond UI—I design and implement **authentication flows, backend integrations, and system-level features** such as secure email delivery, while maintaining clean, scalable front-end architecture.

Alongside building, I write in-depth technical articles that help developers understand how real-world systems are built and shipped.
